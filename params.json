This guide provides a useful look at the\r\nstandard C programming language.  In no way does this guide attempt to teach one how to\r\nprogram in C, nor will it attempt to provide the history of C or the various implementations of it.\r\nIt is merely a handy reference to the standard C library.  This guide is not a definitive look at the\r\nentire ANSI C standard.  Some outdated information has been left out.  It is simply a quick\r\nreference to the functions and syntax of the language.  All efforts have been taken to make sure\r\nthe information contained herein is correct, but no guarantees are made.  Nearly all of the\r\ninformation was obtained from the official ANSI C Standard published in 1989 in the document\r\nANSI X3.159-1989.  The associated International Organization for Standardization document,\r\nISO 9899-1990, is a near duplicate of the ANSI standard.\r\n<p>\r\nThis guide is divided into two sections.  The first part, \"Language\", is an analysis of the\r\nsyntax and the environment.  The second part, \"Library\", is a list of the functions available in the\r\nstandard C library.  These parts were designed to insure conformity among various\r\nimplementations of the C language.  Not all information from the ANSI standard is contained in\r\nthis guide.  Additional reference may be made to the actual ANSI publication.\r\n<hr>\r\n<center>\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/RandyMcMillan/CGuide\">https://github.com/RandyMcMillan/CGuide</a>\r\n</center>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
