CGuide is an ANSI C Reference
====
CGuide is built using the Cordova iOS and OSX frameworks and can serve as a demonstration of how to build a Universal iOS and OSX app using web technologies. These Xcode projects bundle [Eric Huss's C LIbrary Reference Guide](http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/) into an iOS App that runs on iOS devices and also an OSX app that runs on a Mac Desktop.
